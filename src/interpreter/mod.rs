//! Interpreter scaffolding for the Duet language runtime.
//!
//! Programs expressed in our DSL are translated into Syndicated Actor VM
//! actionsâ€”spawning facets, sending messages, awaiting assertions, and so on.
//! This module provides the AST, parser, and runtime hooks that let higher-level
//! tools (like `codebased`) interpret those programs without hand-writing actor
//! logic.
