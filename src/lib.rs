//! Duet Runtime â€“ A causally consistent, time-travelable Syndicated Actor runtime
//!
//! This crate implements the Syndicated Actor model with:
//! - Deterministic, causally ordered turns that can be replayed or rewound
//! - Persistent storage of every turn plus periodic full-state snapshots
//! - Time-travel debugging: step forward/backward, jump to any turn, fork branches
//! - CRDT-based branch merging
//! - CLI + control plane for inspection and control
//! - Integration of external services as deterministic Syndicated entities
